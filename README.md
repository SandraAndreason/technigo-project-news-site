# News Site

Brief description:
The task is to build a news site that contains a header, a main article and a grid och smaller articles. 

I started to design the news site on a paper with some inspiration from the news site "Daily Ziko". Since I have a big interest in dogs and dog training I got very inspired by his site and I liked the style. After that I looked at the HTML and the CSS from "Daily Ziko" to see the structure and how it was build. To build my site I used Google and the HTML and CSS from other sites.
